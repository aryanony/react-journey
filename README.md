⚛️ React Journey 🚀

Welcome to my React.js Development Playground 🎨 — a living repository where I document my hands-on learning, daily practice apps, and experimental projects throughout my React training and beyond.

This repo is not just a code dump 💾 — it’s my digital portfolio-in-progress 📚, showcasing my evolving skill set as I dive deeper into the React ecosystem.

📂 Repository Structure

Every folder here represents a standalone React application 🖥️ — built as part of:

📖 Training sessions & assignments

🧪 Experimental practice apps

🛠️ Mini projects for concept reinforcement

🎯 Hands-on exercises to master React fundamentals & advanced topics


Since learning is continuous, project names, types, and frequency are dynamic ⚡ — this repo will grow organically as I explore new React concepts.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Ecosystem

⚛️ React.js (Functional Components, Hooks, JSX, State & Props)

🌐 JavaScript (ES6+)

🎨 HTML5 & CSS3 / Tailwind CSS

🔗 API Integrations & Fetching

📦 npm / Node.js environment

🧩 Upcoming: React Router, Context API, Redux, and beyond
